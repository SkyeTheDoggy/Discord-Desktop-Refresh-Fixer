# Discord Desktop Refresh Fixer (BETA)

A theme that aims to improve and undo some of the less popular changes introduced in Discord’s new Desktop Visual Refresh.

### ⚠️ Please Note:
- This is a **BETA**, so it’s still a work in progress.
- Some parts may be broken or incomplete.
- Updates and improvements are planned over time.

### 💾 How to Use:
You can install and use the theme with any custom Discord client, like [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) or [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/).

### 💡 Why?
Not everyone loves the new UI. This theme is for those who prefer the old layout and want to revert some of Discord’s recent changes, such as:
- The user bar overlapping both the channels list and server list.
- The bulky top bar that takes up too much space.
- And more tweaks coming soon!

### ✅ To-Do:
- Revert server icons (guilds bar) to the classic circular style.
- Restore original icon sizes for a less cramped look.
- Fix UI bugs and inconsistencies.
