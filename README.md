# Discord Desktop Refresh Fixer (BETA)

A theme that aims to improve and undo some of the less popular changes introduced in Discord‚Äôs new Desktop Visual Refresh.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Please Note
- This is a **BETA**, so it‚Äôs still a work in progress.
- Some parts may be broken or incomplete.
- Updates and improvements are planned over time.

### üíæ How to Use
You can install and use the theme with any custom Discord client, like [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) or [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Users & Custom Title Bars

If you're on **Windows** or your client uses the **Discord‚Äôs built-in title bar** instead of the system one, make sure to **remove or comment out** the following lines in your CSS file:

```css
bar_c38106, .bar_c38106 *, .title_c38106, .title_c38106 * {
    overflow: hidden !important;
    height: 0 !important;
}

.base_c48ade {
    margin-top: -37px;
}
```

### üí° Why?
Not everyone loves the new UI. This theme is for those who prefer the old layout and want to revert some of Discord‚Äôs recent changes, such as:
- The user bar overlapping both the channels list and server list.
- The bulky top bar that takes up too much space.
- And more tweaks coming soon!

---

### ‚úÖ To-Do
- Revert server icons (guilds bar) to the classic circular style.
- Restore original icon sizes for a less cramped look.
- Fix UI bugs and inconsistencies.
